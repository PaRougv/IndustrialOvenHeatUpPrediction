# Industrial Oven Heat-Up Prediction

Predict the time required for an industrial oven to reach a target temperature using machine learning.

This project uses historical oven temperature data to train a predictive model that estimates how long an oven will take to heat up to a desired temperature. It is useful for industrial planning, efficiency optimization, and reducing manual guesswork.
